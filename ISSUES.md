# GORM Scaling Program — Change Log and Optimization Backlog

This document now tracks what has already changed for the O(M+N) scaling work and what can still be optimized. It is no longer a failure tracker.

---

## Current in-progress handoff snapshot (latest)

### Active item
- **2.B.1:** Profile tenant context wrapping frequency in static API calls.

### Implemented and Validated (Final status: GREEN)

#### `GormRegistry` normalization boundary + caches
File: `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormRegistry.groovy`
- Added caches:
  - `normalizedEntityKeysByClass`
  - `normalizedEntityKeysByName`
  - `normalizedQualifiers`
- Added helper methods:
  - `normalizeEntityKey(Class)`
  - `normalizeEntityKey(String)`
  - `normalizeQualifier(String)`
- Wired normalized access into:
  - `getStaticApi/getInstanceApi/getValidationApi`
  - `getDatastore`
  - `registerApi`
  - `registerDatastore`
  - `registerDatastoreByQualifier`
  - `registerEntityDatastore`
  - `registerEntityDatastores`
- Added cache cleanup in `GormRegistry.reset()`.

#### API registries normalized key/qualifier usage
Files:
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/AbstractGormApiRegistry.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormStaticApiRegistry.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormInstanceApiRegistry.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormValidationApiRegistry.groovy`

Changes:
- Normalize class keys in `register/get/containsKey`.
- Normalize qualifier before non-default checks and `forQualifier(...)`.

#### Audit repeated findDatastore/qualifier fallback chains and collapse duplicate branches
Files:
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormApiResolver.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/AbstractGormApiRegistry.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormStaticApiRegistry.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormInstanceApiRegistry.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/main/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormValidationApiRegistry.groovy`

Changes:
- Reused `get(className, qualifier)` inside API registries to prevent duplicate `forQualifier` instantiations when the datastore does not change.
- Simplified `findDatastore` in `GormApiResolver` by removing redundant duplicate `DEFAULT` lookups.

#### Concurrency Testing / Lock Contention Benchmarking
Files:
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormRegistryConcurrencySpec.groovy`

Changes:
- Implemented and ran `GormRegistryConcurrencySpec` confirming safe, high-throughput concurrent access to registry lookups over 1 million total operations across 10 threads. Verified no lock contention failures occur with existing `ConcurrentHashMap` semantics.

#### Tests added/updated for normalization and API resolution behavior
Files:
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormApiRegistrySpec.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormRegistryEntityRegistrationSpec.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormInstanceApiRegistrySpec.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormValidationApiRegistrySpec.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormStaticApiRegistrySpec.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/GormRegistrySpec.groovy`
- `grails-datamapping-core/src/test/groovy/org/grails/datastore/gorm/AbstractGormApiRegistrySpec.groovy`

Coverage added:
- `ConnectionSource.OLD_DEFAULT` + blank qualifiers normalize to `default`.
- Entity keys with surrounding whitespace resolve correctly.
- API registry retrieval works with normalized aliases.
- Verified missing branches and explicit fallback mechanisms for abstract/specific API registries and the central `GormRegistry`.

### Validation status
- Full test suite completed effectively.

### Important worktree context
- There are additional unrelated in-progress test-fix edits present (mainly under `grails-converters` and one file in `grails-datamapping-validation`).
- Do not revert unrelated changes during continuation unless explicitly requested.

---

## 1) Core changes implemented

### Shared-registry architecture (O(M+N))
- Introduced `GormRegistry` and moved registry responsibilities out of per-tenant duplication paths.
- Refactored `GormEnhancer`, `GormStaticApi`, and `GormInstanceApi` to resolve APIs through shared registry data.
- Updated tenant-aware resolution flow (`Tenants`, enhancer lookup paths, qualifier handling) to match shared registry behavior.

### Datastore integrations aligned to shared model
- Hibernate 7: updated static/instance/enhancer APIs and related datastore/session/query wiring to use the new registry approach.
- Hibernate 5: parallel alignment with H7 so API behavior stays consistent across both engines.
- MongoDB: updated static API and codec/persister integration points to align with shared registry and tenant resolution changes.
- SimpleMap datastore: large query/persister/session updates to keep core behavior consistent with new registry flow.

### Query and session behavior hardening
- Refined key query/session paths in Hibernate and SimpleMap implementations where registry and tenant context are used.
- Added or adjusted session-resolver/runtime utilities where needed to keep API behavior stable under multi-tenancy.

### Transform and compile-time behavior updates
- Updated service and transactional transform logic to match registry/data access changes.
- Reorganized transform test assets (including moved/expanded transform specs/classes).

### Test coverage expanded for scale + regressions
- Added `GormRegistryScalabilitySpec` coverage across core modules (core, H5, H7, Mongo).
- Added and updated regression coverage around enhancer, static API, transaction manager, and transform behavior.

### Local selected-module workflow improvements
- Selected-module runs now enforce CodeNarc/Checkstyle aggregation without forcing PMD/SpotBugs in that path.
- `testSelected` flow remains focused on selected modules with aggregated test/style outputs.

## 2) Potential optimization opportunities

## A. Registry/API hot-path efficiency
**Goal:** reduce repeated lookup overhead under high tenant/entity counts.

1. [DONE] Cache normalized entity keys and qualifier maps in one place to reduce repeated normalization work.
2. [DONE] Audit repeated `findDatastore`/qualifier fallback chains and collapse duplicate branches.
3. [DONE] Benchmark `computeIfAbsent` and lock contention patterns in registry-heavy paths.

## B. Tenant context and session routing
**Goal:** lower context-switch overhead and reduce accidental cross-context work.

1. Profile tenant context wrapping frequency in static API calls.
2. Identify places where tenant/session context can be propagated once instead of re-resolved.
3. Add targeted perf specs for DISCRIMINATOR and SCHEMA mode query loops.

## C. Query builder/runtime allocation pressure
**Goal:** reduce temporary object churn in frequently executed query paths.

1. Review HQL/criteria builder allocation patterns in H5/H7 and SimpleMap query implementations.
2. Reuse immutable query metadata where safe.
3. Add microbenchmarks for common `list/find/count` paths with multi-tenant datasets.

## D. Transform pipeline cost
**Goal:** reduce compile-time overhead from service/transaction transforms.

1. Measure transform execution hotspots after recent refactors.
2. Consolidate duplicated transform helper logic.
3. Add performance-oriented transform tests focused on large service sets.

## E. Test/runtime throughput
**Goal:** keep regression coverage while reducing local/CI cycle time.

1. Keep scalability specs, but tune dataset sizes for stable signal-to-cost ratio.
2. Split long-running integration groups where practical.
3. Continue selected-module execution strategy for local iteration, full-suite in CI.

## 3) Suggested tracking format for future updates

When adding new work items to this file:
- Record the **change** under section 1 with module + behavior impact.
- Record follow-up work under section 2 with a short **goal** and concrete next actions.
- Avoid adding pass/fail snapshots here; keep this file architectural and optimization-focused.
